        "A long, long time ago the World was in an age of Chaos. "In the midst
        of this chaos, in a little kingdom in the land of Hyrule, a legend was
        being handed down from generation to generation, the legend of the
        'Triforce'; golden triangles possessing mystical powers. One day, an
        evil army attacked this peaceful little kingdom and stole the Triforce
        of Power. This army was led by Ganon, the powerful Prince of Darkness
        who sought to plunge the World into fear and darkness under his rule.
        Fearing his wicked rule, Zelda, the princess of this kingdom, split up
        the Triforce of Wisdom into eight fragments and hid them throughout the
        realm to save the last remaining Triforce from the clutches of the evil
        Ganon. At the same time, she commanded her most trustworthy nursemaid,
        Impa, to secretly escape into the land and go find a man with enough
        courage to destroy the evil Ganon. Upon hearing this, Ganon grew angry,
        imprisoned the princess, and sent out a party in search of Impa."
        "Braving forests and mountains, Impa fled for her life from her
        pursuers. As she reached the very limit of her energy she found herself
        surrounded by Ganon's evil henchmen. Cornered! What could she do? ...
        But wait! All was not lost. A young lad appeared. He skillfully drove
        off Ganon's henchmen, and saved Impa from a fate worse than death." "His
        name was Link. During his travels, he had come across Impa and Ganon's
        henchmen. Impa told Link the whole story of Princess Zelda and the evil
        Ganon. Burning with a sense of justice, Link resolved to save Zelda, but
        Ganon was a powerful opponent. He held the Triforce of Power. And so, in
        order to fight off Ganon, Link had to bring the scattered eight
        fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom together to rebuild the mystical
        triangle. If he couldn't do this, there would be no chance Link could
        fight his way into Death Mountain where Ganon lived." "Can Link really
        destroy Ganon and save Princess Zelda? "Only your skill can answer that
        question. Good luck. Use the Triforce wisely."

      <p class="page-story">
        Although rather basic by today's standards and in comparison to most
        later installments of the franchise, the gameplay of the original The
        Legend of Zelda introduced a revolutionary level of gaming for its time
        that has since become standard for the series (and other games inspired
        by it), one that includes roleplaying, action, adventure, and
        puzzle/logic.

      <h3 class="subtitle">Dungeon Exploration</h3>
      <p class="page-story">
        Barring Link's progress are Creatures he must battle to locate the
        entrances to nine underground Dungeons. Each Dungeon is a unique,
        maze-like collection of rooms connected by doors and secret passages and
        guarded by monsters different from those found in the Overworld. Link
        must successfully navigate each Dungeon to obtain one of the eight
        pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom. Dungeons also conceal useful items,
        such as a Boomerang for retrieving items and stunning Enemies and a
        Flute with magical properties. The first six Dungeons have visible
        entrances, but the remaining three are hidden. Except for the final
        Dungeon - Death Mountain, which can't be entered until the previous
        eight have been completed, the order of completing Dungeons is somewhat
        arbitrary, but many Dungeons can only be reached or completed using
        items gained in the previous one.
