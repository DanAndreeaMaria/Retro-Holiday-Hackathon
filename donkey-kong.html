        The game occurs after Donkey Kong Land 3, with King K. Rool returning in
        a mechanical island armed with the Blast-O-Matic to destroy Donkey Kong
        Island. The plan fails as the island crashes, damaging the weapon. K.
        Rool captures Diddy, Lanky, Tiny, and Chunky Kongs, steals Golden
        Bananas, and locks them away. Donkey Kong, alerted by Squawks, trains
        with Cranky to gain the Simian Slam ability and begins his mission. He
        frees K. Lumsy, a friendly Kritter, who helps unlock new areas like
        Jungle Japes. Donkey Kong reunites with allies like Funky, Candy, and
        Snide while collecting Golden Bananas and other items. The Kongs tackle
        challenges in worlds such as Angry Aztec, Frantic Factory, and Gloomy
        Galleon, rescuing imprisoned Kongs, unlocking upgrades, and defeating
        bosses guarding keys to K. Lumsy's cage. Key collectibles include Banana
        Medals, blueprints for the Blast-O-Matic, and Nintendo and Rareware
        Coins, vital for accessing later stages. The adventure culminates in
        Hideout Helm, where the Kongs shut down the Blast-O-Matic and obtain the
        final key. K. Lumsy is freed, inadvertently disabling K. Rool's escape.
        The Kongs face him in a boxing match, ultimately defeating him. The game
        concludes with a celebration at Donkey Kong's house. Players control one
        of five Kongs, each with unique abilities needed to retrieve Golden
        Bananas, explore vast levels, and progress through the story.

      <p class="page-story">
        The player controls one of the five available Kongs, who must venture
        into open and vast levels similar to those found in Super Mario 64.
        Their objective in every level is to obtain the Golden Bananas among
        other collectibles. Only Donkey Kong is available from the start, and
        the other four Kongs, Diddy Kong, Lanky Kong, Tiny Kong, and Chunky
        Kong, are eventually freed and become available during the adventure.
        The player can use the Tag Barrels, located throughout every level, to
        switch to another Kong to play as. All five Kongs are required for
        completing the game because each of them must use their unique abilities
        to recover the Golden Bananas. There are 25 Golden Bananas in every
        level, and each of the five Kongs have their own five Golden Bananas to
        obtain. Banana Bunch Coins are currency used by the Kongs to pay for
        Cranky Kong's, Funky Kong's, and Candy Kong's respective services. At
        Cranky's Lab, the Kongs can purchase a potion to learn a unique ability.
        At Funky's Store, each Kong can purchase their own weapon that fires a
        certain type of ammo.
        <img
          src="elements/dk-gif-2.gif"
          alt="Donkey Kong gameplay GIF"
          class="gameplay-img"
        />
        At Candy's Music Shop, the Kongs can purchase their own musical
        instrument to perform on a Music Pad. Cranky offers more abilities to
        the Kongs in the later levels, and likewise, Candy and Funky offer more
        upgrades in later levels. DK Isles is the hub area from where the Kongs
        can access the other levels. Every level has its own lobby on DK Isles
        and a portal leading into the level itself. At first, the level lobbies
        are blocked or inaccessible by the Kongs. To unlock a level's lobby, the
        Kongs must use a Boss Key to open a padlock of K. Lumsy's cage. This
        results in K. Lumsy happily celebrating and creating a tremor that
        unlocks access into a lobby (with the exception of the first level,
        Jungle Japes, which is accessed after Donkey Kong meets K. Lumsy). In
        every lobby, B. Locker prevents the Kongs from entering a level unless
        they have at least a certain number of Golden Bananas to meet B.
        Locker's requirement. The later levels require the Kongs to have more
        Golden Bananas in order to enter. Every level has a boss whose arena is
        accessible from the Troff 'N' Scoff location, Here the Kongs feed Scoff
        with a certain number of bananas, and as Scoff eats them, he
        progressively becomes larger. Eventually Scoff becomes large enough for
        Troff's platform to be raised up to the key for Troff to unlock the door
        leading to the level boss. Each boss can only be fought by a certain
        Kong, whose face appears on the door just before the battle. The boss
        battles are constructed around the designated Kong's abilities. After
        that Kong defeats the boss, the Kongs obtain a Boss Key. The game
        features two Animal Friends, Rambi and Enguarde, who each have an animal
        crate located in Jungle Japes and Gloomy Galleon respectively. Only
        Donkey Kong can transform into Rambi and only Lanky can transform into
        Enguarde. Rambi can attack enemies and smash crates and wooden walls,
        and Enguarde can attack enemies and smash open chests to reveal hidden
        items.
