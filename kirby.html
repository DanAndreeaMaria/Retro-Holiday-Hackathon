        “ Light years away, on a tiny star not visible from Earth, is the
        magical, peaceful place known as Dream Land. The beings that inhabit
        this wonderful place live a blissful existence that centers on eating,
        sleeping, and playing. An example of their care-free customs include the
        traditional after-lunch feast nap. After they awaken from their nap, the
        Dream Landers discuss their dreams and fervently hope that each other's
        fondest wishes come true. One day, a young Dream Lander named Kirby
        awoke from his after-lunch nap feeling terrible. "What happened?" he
        wondered to himself. "I didn't have any dreams during my lunch nap!"
        This lack of dreams left Kirby feeling very uneasy. After talking to
        some of his friends, he found that the problem was much more serious
        than he had thought, for they had not experienced any dreams either!
        "Something must have happened to the Dream Spring!" they exclaimed in
        unison. The Dream Spring is a magical well that is a reservoir for all
        the dreams of the inhabitants of Dream Land. Dreams also flow out of the
        Dream Spring and envelop Dream Land, granting all sleeping beings
        enjoyable dreams. Legends told that the Dream Spring was created by a
        magical artifact known as the Star Rod. The sparkling star on the tip of
        this scepter was an actual fragment of a star that had landed in Dream
        Land in the distant past. The Star Rod now provided energy to the Dream
        Spring and served as the very symbol of Dream Land. The lack of dreams
        made everyone in Dream Land feel restless and irritable.

        The joyful laughter that had once resounded throughout Dream Land could
        no longer be heard at all. Things were bleak. Kirby, the roly-poly hero
        of Dream Land, boldly announced his intention to investigate the Dream
        Spring and find the cause of all the trouble. Upon reaching the Dream
        Spring, who did he find but King Dedede, bathing in its magical waters!
        In the past (see Kirby's Dream Land™ for Game Boy®), King Dedede had
        caused mischief in Dream Land by stealing all the Dream Landers' food
        and Sparkling Stars. Now, in the middle of the Dream Spring, in place of
        the Star Rod, sat Dedede, covered with bubble bath. "So you're up to
        your old tricks again, eh, Dedede?!" accused Kirby. "What are you
        talking about, young pudge ball?" Dedede looked surprised. "I thought
        I'd do everyone a favor by..." "No, no no!" Kirby shook his head. "I
        won't listen to your tricks! What have you done with the Star Rod?!"
        "Oh, that old thing," Dedede said nonchalantly. "I broke it into seven
        pieces and gave each piece to one of my friends..." "What was Dedede
        thinking?!" Kirby wondered. Before hearing any more of what Dedede had
        to say, Kirby set off on the long trek to gather the pieces of the Star
        Rod and return them to the Dream Spring. Hopefully, he could return the
        sparkle to the Dream Spring so that the people of Dream Land could again
        enjoy their happy midday naps.” — A Crisis in Dream Land! • Kirby's

        “ One day, the peaceful life of Dream Land was shattered by a mysterious
        crisis! The inhabitants didn't dream! On the edge of Dream Land, dreams
        and hope once gushed forth from the Dream Spring, fueled by the Star
        Rod. Investigating the Dream Spring, Kirby found naughty King Dedede
        swimming in its magical waters! Dedede had broken the Star Rod and given
        the pieces to his friends, who are now hiding in Dream Land! To bring
        back the lost dreams, Kirby sought the Star Rod!” — Intro • Kirby's
        Adventure
      </p>
      <p class="page-story">
        Kirby's Adventure's story is linear. Each stage is a side-scrolling
        platformer, with various enemies scattered around it, and each stage
        finishing with a Goal Game. When one stage is cleared, the door to the
        next stage appears in the level's lobby. What makes the game lobby
        unique from most other games is that it is part of the actual game. The
        game lobby is played like the side-scrolling stages. The entire game is
        made of seven individual lobbies each with five to seven stages. Every
        last stage is a boss battle for a piece of the Star Rod, and after a
        boss is defeated, the boss room becomes the entrance to the next level.
        There are also sub-games in each lobby. Each level has one to three
        different sub-game rooms. Depending on the player's progress through the
        sub-games, they may earn bonus points or extra lives.
        <img
          src="elements/kirby-gif-3.gif"

          class="gameplay-img"
        />
        A common one of these is the Museum, in which Kirby can swallow one or
        two different enemies for a free Copy Ability (the enemies cannot hurt
        him in this room). There is also the Arena, in which Kirby can fight a
        mid-boss to earn a Maxim Tomato and the mid-boss' ability, as well the
        Warp Star Station, in which Kirby may take a Warp Star directly to
        another level. Sometimes, these bonus rooms must be unlocked through the
        use of secret switches in various stages. Beating the game unlocks a
        V.S. Boss! mode on the main menu in which the player can face every boss
        in a row, and a Bonus Games mode in which the player can play each of
        the sub-games separately. Pressing all of the switches in the stages to
        unlock all of the sub-games in the levels will bring the game to 100%
        completion on the main menu and unlock the Extra Game. Beating the Extra
        Game will unlock the ability to Listen to Sounds for the game.
      </p>
      <h1 class="page-subtitle">Goal game</h1>
      <p class="page-story">
        After each stage, the player plays a Goal Game where Kirby jumps on a
        spring platform. The goal is to press the A button when the platform is
        at its lowest--this sends Kirby to the top level and nets a 1UP.
        Otherwise, the player scores between 5,000 to 100 points if Kirby
        reaches any of the lower 6 platforms, depending on how close the timing
        is to perfect.
